			"value": "Giving a nod to old school style, these women's 574 trainers from New Balance are footwear classics. Originally a hybrid of two separate sneakers, these mashed up essentials have been making an impact ever since '88. Suede and mesh panelling to the upper keep the foot fresh and supported, while the 574's EVA Encap midsole delivers lightweight cushioning coated with polyurethane for added shock absorption. In an 'off white' colourway, they're finished with a solid rubber outsole for grippy traction every step of the way, as well as New Balance's world famous 'N' logo to the sidewalls."

			"text": "I love these shoes the colors are popping. I gave 3 stars because when the shoes arrived it was clear one shoe had been tried on and had obvious creases in them already. The tissue was balled up and torn. It's like the person handling online returns didn't even open the box. If I'm paying $100 plus for a pair of shoes I don't want to see creases in them. However, when u called customer service they were extremely helpful they said I could return the shoes to any store but unfortunately they don't sell NB in stores.. yay me!",

I usually wear a W 9, go up 1/2 size for arch inserts. These, my toe is right at the top. They're just not comfortable at all, there's no arch support without an insert. And since these aren't in-store, I can't just try exchanging or returning to the store, very disappointed. Especially for the price. Will try on again a little later just in the apartment, but right now it looks like a return will be made. Picture is of my old beloved 574 that was discontinued",

I really liked those shoes was very disappointed, they were very comfortable. After that I ordered 574's, size 6, they were actually tight. The heels (inside) are already getting holes in them! So I walked in them anyway, give them time to stretch. I then ordered the 574's in 6 1/2, they are better. You have to understand I started out with 505's that I still have but the soles are wore out, They are the best shoe!I have 6 other NB shoes in different colors that I wear all the time, with my jeans. Too bad you can't make a quality shoe like the 505's. I'm guessing they are pretty old, but a good shoe!",

			"text": "First of all, I love the look of these shoes. They fit me perfectly. Unfortunately, they can be super painful when worn. I am not sure if this is due to the fact that they are still in the process of being broken in, but I received pretty bad blisters on the backs of my ankles after wearing them for only a couple of hours. The third time I wore the shoes they actually made my ankles bleed. I wore the sneakers with no show socks-looking back I probably should have worn taller socks- but I have never had this issue with any pair of sneakers before while wearing the same style of sock. Hopefully, this problem is resolved after breaking in the shoes. I am not sure if I would wear them to work out in as they seem to be more a fashion sneaker.",

In the two years I have had them, my feet never tire walking in them. I wear them to my job that requires me to be on my feet for hours and when travelling. The durability of them cannot be understated either. As I have said, I wear them everyday, and the shoes are still in great shape. Of course there is some wear and tear, but how they have held up is incredibly impressive.I LOVE these shoes!",

I Googled the differences between these styles and was led to believe that the only substantial difference was the sole - the 574's are chunkier and have some plastic thing, but I was ok with that.When they came in the mail, I tried them on and before I even had the chance to look and see if I liked them, I immediately noticed a bad difference. Even though I had ordered the exact same size I had for my 373's, these didn't fit quite right and were tight in different places. Had I tried on this pair of shoes in a store, I would have taken them off and walked away based on fit alone. However, I put both shoes on and walked around, looking at them to see if they at least looked cute. If this is your style, that is totally fine, but I did not like them! While the 373 has a slightly tapered toe, the 574 is very very rounded and almost boxy, they reminded me of the Mary Jane style kid's shoes I used to wear to church as a toddler.This is long, so I apologize for that. There is a chance other people will love this shoe so I don't want to dissuade shoppers based on anything other than this: IF YOU ARE TRYING TO REPLACE YOUR 373 SERIES SNEAKERS, DO NOT BUY 574!

			"text": "These are THE best-looking sneaker I have seen in a long time. The \"Overcast\" color is a beautiful shade of grey that goes with literally everything. Very cool retro look and super comfy as well. I usually wear a 9 1/2 or 10, depending on the manufacturer and style. The 10 was too big, and although the 9 1/2 was the right length, it was too wide for my foot. My foot is not very narrow, in fact, borderline narrow / standard. This is really a 5-star shoe, and I definitely would have kept them, but for me it didn't work because of the sizing.",
